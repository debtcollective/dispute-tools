 * discourse users. The `to` and `from` properties in the constructor
 * configuration object should be strings or arrays of strings
 * of discourse usernames. Duplicates are filtered out before
 * the message is sent.
 *
 * This will ultimately produce a private topic in Discourse
 * in which the `system` user and all the users in the
 * `from` and `to` configuration fields are included. If this doesn't
 * make sense, please take some time to understand how Discourse
 * treats private messages between users. At this time it is not
 * possible to prevent the `system` user from being included in
 * the private message.
 *
 * Config can be undefined. In the cases of most discourse messages
 * the only thing that should be passed in is the topicId, which
 * makes the to, from, and subject fields irrelevant.
