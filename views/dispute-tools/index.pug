            p.pb2.-fw-500 For decades we have been forced to debt finance basic needs as the cost of living has skyrocketed and wages have flatlined. While we have struggled to keep food on the table and care for our families our wages have been garnished, our tax returns seized, and our credit destroyed.

              li You are being harassed by a debt collector
              li You are trapped by a predatory lender
              li You borrowed for healthcare, education, or other basic necessities
              li You can’t afford to pay your debt
              li You are disputing your debt as an act of solidarity with other people
              li You were defrauded by your school.
              li You took out a loan to help a family member pay for college or other basic needs
